# COBOL Challenges

This section contains exercises that test your ability to resolve bugs and other issues in COBOL programs.

## COBOL Challenge 1

In this challenge, we take an existing program from the previous section of the course and enhance a report, adding in a few bugs to tackle along the way. The aim of this section is to walk you through the process of resolving those errors.
