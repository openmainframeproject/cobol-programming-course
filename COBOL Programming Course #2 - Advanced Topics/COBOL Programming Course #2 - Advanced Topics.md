# COBOL Challenges

As you have now handled some basic exercises, we have prepared a new section containing more advanced exercises that test your ability to resolve bugs and other issues in COBOL programs. Each exercise will have a short description and a goal to be accomplished.

In case you get stuck, a blog with instructions will be published shortly after each exercise.

Happy Coding!

## COBOL Challenge - Debugging

It is 2020 in Washington, D.C. John Doe runs a program which provides financial reports on US Presidents and tallies the number of reports from the state of Virginia. Everything seems OK. (see below)

John is satisfied, as he can see that everything is working as it should be. He calls it a day and goes home.

The next day, when he comes back to the office, his colleague Mari tells him ‚ÄúI‚Äôve made some changes to one of your programs so that it also tallies the number of presidents who spent more than their allowed limit. Check it out.‚Äù

He runs his usual reports and sees the following:

Clearly, Mari‚Äôs changes to the program that generates the reports have broken something.

Can you fix the code to get the correct result? The new source code is named **CBL0106** and the JCL is **CBL0106J**. In case you get stuck, the solution is in the file **CBL0106C**. 

You can find them in the github repository for the COBOL course, in the subfolder **/COBOL Programming Course #2 - Advanced Topics/Challenges/Debugging**.

# COBOL Challenge - The Covid 19 Reports

Today, you are tasked to create a COVID-19 Summary Report of all the countries around the world. The information will come from COVID19API website.

Here are the instructions:

- Extract the response from this API: https://api.covid19api.com/summary. You will receive a JSON file that is similar to the photo below:

![](Images/cobolchCOV19-img1.png)

- Convert that file to CSV format. It should look like this. In my example, I only chose the ‚ÄúCountries‚Äù part.

- Using Zowe, Upload the CSV file that you have created to mainframe.

`Hint: you can use the command zowe files ul ftds ‚Äúfile location‚Äù ‚Äúdataset name‚Äù`

- Create a new member in your *.CBL Dataset to write your COBOL program.

`Hint: This step can be done using Zowe Explorer and Zowe CLI`

- Begin writing your COBOL program

- In your COBOL program, you have to read the uploaded CSV file and re-format it to display the contents like this:

```
********************************************************************
DATE: 2020-04-22
TIME: T16:54:5
COUNTRY: "Antigua and Barbuda"
COUNTRY CODE: "AG"
SLUG: "antigua-and-barbuda"
NEW CONFIRMED CASES: 00000
TOTAL CONFIRMED CASES: 00023
NEW DEATHS: 00000
TOTAL DEATHS: 00003
NEW RECOVERIES: 00004
TOTAL RECOVERIES: 00007
********************************************************************
```

- Optional: A more advance approach is to reformat it into a Report Form like this:

- Compile and Test your work

- Optional: Automate. Using NPM and Zowe CLI, Run all these steps and create a ‚Äúone click‚Äù COBOL build similar to this.

I hope this could be a good COBOL challenge to anybody who is willing to try.
