## FAQ

#### Where do I start the COBOL Course?
To get started with the first COBOL Course, follow [these steps](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/cobol-programming-course/blob/master/COBOL%20Programming%20Course%20%231%20-%20Getting%20Started/README.md#how-to-get-started).

#### How do I enroll for system access?
You can enroll for system access [here](https://www-01.ibm.com/events/wwe/ast/mtm/cobolvscode.nsf/enrollall?openform).

#### "I'm having a very hard time connecting with the mainframe.  What should I do?"
1. Post your .yaml file in the Slack Channel Forum, but don't post any passwords. .yaml location: C:\Users<your Win Id>.zowe\profiles\zosmf\LearnCOBOL.yaml. Hopefully, someone can help you spot the problem.
2. Try shutting down VSCode and relaunch.
3. If that doesn't work, shut down VSCode, try deleting the .yaml file, relauch and create a New Connection again. 
4. If still unsuccessful, it is possible that your password needs to be reset on the system.
5. If clicking on the "Refresh All" icon to the right of "DATA SETS" or the "Search Data Sets..." icon to the right of "LearnCOBOL" (also in the "DATA SETS" area) and nothing happens, try clicking on "LearnCOBOL" itself in the "JOBS" area. If you receive, "Check Credentials" (Blue pop-up box appears), click it, re-authenticate at top.  Ignore any "rse" error messages.
6. Other things to try, watch this video.  The presenter actually walks through the process, although I think it was with an older, more stable version of IBM Z Open Editor.  [Get hands on!
