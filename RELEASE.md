# Release guidelines

This project is generally a rolling release project ( meaning the latest HEAD of master is the current materials ), but generally it's advised that those looking to leverage these materials in something downstream ( such as other training materials or labs enviroments ) pull from the [latest release tag](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/cobol-programming-course/releases) which makes it easier to see where the materials derived from.

Releases are cut usually once a month from the then current HEAD of master, and provided as pdfs and source code only.
