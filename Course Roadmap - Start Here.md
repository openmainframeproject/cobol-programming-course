Welcome to the Open Mainframe Project, Cobol Programming Course!

To get the greatest benefit out of this course, please follow the instructions that follow, STEP by STEP.

Request your mainframe credentials: here

The return email should direct them: here

and instruct them to (or suggest they) download the PDF Version of the class instruction manual (materials), COBOL Programming with VSCode. The free Acrobat Reader can be downloaded if needed to view the .pdf file. Note: The .md version is the official, up-to-the-minute updated version of the class materials. The .pdf version is generated from the .md version on a regular basis, so it may not reflect the most up-to-date changes. A version number/date to be published within the .pdf document has been proposed by project participants, so currently, it is not easily determinable if the .pdf version includes the absolute most recent updates and corrections made to the .md version.

Also a reminder to please follow the instructions, STEP by STEP and to always substitute their Z8xxxx id, issued above, in place of the example id, Z99998, wherever it is mentioned (as an example) in the class instruction manual.

Also, the return email should include the following IP addresses needed for the course, and explain that the class instruction manual will explain when they will be needed: IP address for VSCode extension: https://192.86.32.250:10443 IP address for TN3270: 192.86.32.250 Port 623 IP address for IDz: 192.86.32.250 Port 4035

Additionally, the slack channel should be mentioned, for questions and discussion: here

FAQ:

"How do I make numbers print properly?" Explanation of Cobol Display Variables.

"I've completed the course, now what?" Try: this or for a real world challenge, try: this.
