## Meeting Minutes:
Attendees: All Core team members & 12 other community participants

1. John opened with an introduction of role/purpose of a TSC:
    * set overall direction for the project
    * ensure have the resources available for success
    * be responsive to the community
2. Core Team members introduced themselves
3. Sudharsana shared the TSC mission and goals (TSC Charter)
4. Mike walked through the restructured content of the repo and all the updates made to the readme.md file.
    * The course content has been split into 3 pieces
        * The beginner course is released in Getting Started 
        * Advanced topics in incubation
        * Testing in incubation
    * The readme.md file is always a good place to start and point people to when they are getting started with this content
    * The Getting Started book points to Providers who provide system access for doing the labs.
    * There is a commercial offering folder that showcases IDz. Note: this is the free trial version of the tool
5. Mike reviewed PR #103 (Scott Cosel's PR) with the following suggestions:
    * Create a separate document for the FAQs and the Resources- this will help to keep the readme.md file simple and clear
    * Suggest pointing to the [COBOL video page](https://developer.ibm.com/technologies/cobol/series/cobol-fridays-webinar-videos) as opposed to individual video replays, etc. This will avoid data discrepancy/duplication and give access to all the other COBOL resources available on the [COBOL hub page](https://developer.ibm.com/technologies/cobol/)
    * Scott was good with these suggestions.
6. Q&A
#### How do we handle questions coming to Slack from Coursera offering?
The core team will discuss this further on next weekly call

#### Setting a path for "What's next": are we going to put JCL as an important part of "Starting COBOL with z/OS" course - asking, because I can see a lot of people on Slack, having issues about understanding JCL, all those double slashes, dots, DD limitations etc
This course is all about COBOL. And, the thought is with the DevOps tools available, focus can be on COBOL and the JCL part of it taken care by the modernization of the environment and tooling.That said, we would like to point our participants to the z/OS Practitioner that dives into JCL
