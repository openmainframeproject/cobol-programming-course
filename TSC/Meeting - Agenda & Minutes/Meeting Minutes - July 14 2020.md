5. Q&A
#### What is possible to do within the zOS instance?
Paul responded the goal of this course is to address beginner level COBOL with modern tooling. To that end, the goal is to introduce learners to zOS and enterprise COBOL

#### What is the end product? Any strategy to market to universities
The course on OMP was created with the intent and goal for academics / universities to take this and use for a semester COBOL Class. 
Sudharsana talked about IBM's Academic Initiative team and happy to connect David with the team to further explore opportunities with UNCC
Cameron Saey mentioned a series of classes offered at ECU.

#### Any plans to merge this content with Master the Mainframe?
No. MtM is to give a broader understanding of Mainframes and zOS. While there is a little overlap this course is primarily focussed on COBOL.
